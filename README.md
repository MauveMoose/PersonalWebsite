HTML, Javascript and PHP code for my Personal Portfolio website. Best viewed via localhost with Apache and MySQL active through XAMPP.

Images and videos used in the site are included. Its purpose is to demonstrate my photography portfolio, but I hope reviewing the code will give you a better understanding of my abilities.
